    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise my potential client to secure his/her website in multiple ways. There are many web security threats, but also many good efficient web security practices that can be used to secure a website. Make sure that all the data their system is accepting is in the correct format, also called sanitization of data. Either by using a good third-party solution, or manually. Use HTTPS and HSTS, which encrypts the data that is sent between the client and the server, making it more secure and less available to attackers. Use a framework or an open-standard authorization protocol to secure authentication and authorization. Secure strong passwords, preferably two-factor authentication. Furthermore I would advise them to do good research regarding third-party applications, as there are many out there, and to go for one that is up to date, well tested and trusted with good reviews from trusted sources. Be up to date on the most popular threats. Integrate a good continuous deployment/continuous Integration tool into their pipeline, this will help make sure that all the changes coming to their codebase are security checked first. I would recommend implementing an automatic user timeout, this is to make sure that user credentials that have been hanging for a while in the browser are protected from potential intruders, as well as only display and store data you need. It is a good idea to do mock attacks, to check that their information is safe, as well as automated security testing.
